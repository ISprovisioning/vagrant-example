# Vagrant examples

This repository contains the source code of the hands-on examples in my tutorial on Vagrant, given at [LOADays](http://loadays.org/), 6 April 2014. The presentation itself can be found at <http://github.com/vagrant-presentation/>.

## Trying out the examples

To try out the examples yourself, clone this repository:

`git clone git@github.com:bertvv/vagrant-example.git`

The example starts with a minimal `Vagrantfile` and is extended progressively. In order to follow along with the tutorial, I created a few "checkpoints" throughout the presentation. If you see a slide mention `checkpoint-nn` (with `nn` a number), you can get the code at that point with

`git checkout tags/checkout-nn`
